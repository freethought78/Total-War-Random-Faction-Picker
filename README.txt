Have you ever sat down to play a new campaign of your favorite flavor of Total War
But you just couldn't decide on a faction?
 
Just run the Random Faction Picker script and choose a game or mod from the Faction Lists.
It will pick a random faction for you to play!
 
You can change the lists manually, they are just text files.

If you want to add or remove a game or mod to/from the faction lists its easy:

Google the game or mod you want to add
Find a list of factions
Create a new text file in the Faction Lists folder
Put a single faction name on each line.
Don't leave any blank spaces.
Give the file a descriptive name.

Now you can use your new faction list!
