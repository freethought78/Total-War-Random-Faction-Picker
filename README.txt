Have you ever sat down to play a new campaign of your favorite flavor of Total War
But you just couldn't figure out which faction to choose?

Just run the Random Faction Picker script and choose a game or mod from the Faction Lists
It will pick a random faction for you to play!

You can change the lists manually, they are just text files
Don't leave any blank spaces

If you want to add or remove a game or mod to/from the faction lists its easy:

Google the game or mod you want to add
Find a list of factions
Create a new text file in the Faction Lists folder
Name it something descriptive
Now you can use your new faction list!

Contribute your lists to our github project so others can use them also at:
